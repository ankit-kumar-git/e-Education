        <p class="secSubTag">Global education is a mental development program that seeks to improve global human development based on the understanding of global dynamics, through the various sectors of human development delivery. In formal education, as a mode of human development delivery, it is integrated into formal educational programs, as an advanced program where global dimensions to local problems are appreciated through interconnectivity. Its first phase began as an undertaking to restructure education and society in the 1960s and 1970s, through the initiatives of educationalists, NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. The program evolves with the internet, and is in its virtual interconnectivity phase, through social media and other global public spheres.

        <p class="secSubTag">Universities in the United States have recently been expanding on the degree programs relating to global education. Many universities offer Bachelor Degree programs and certifications in Global Education, M.S. degrees in Global and International Education, M.A. degrees in International Education, and doctorate degrees in International Education. Not only does the United States have programs for Global Education but so do other countries such as Canada, India, Mexico and European countries. For example, the Finnish Ministry of Education (Finland), in Europe directly put Global Education into their curriculum. They also made Global Education mandatory, meaning you need this in order to improve students critical thinking abilities, their ability to understand the global economy and its complex structure in terms of social and cultural differences.

        <p class="secSubTag">International education refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.[1] It is facilitated by the globalization phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements.[2] The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, formal education and informal learning (e.g. training, exchange programs, cross-cultural communication).[3] It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of "worldmindedness" as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered international.
